Plan is to build a CAD program from scratch. Currently working on implementing some functions for 
vector manipulation in order to implement .stl file creation from a simple 3D.

Completed the functions to write an .stl file given a set of triangles. Next I would like to be able to write ASCII binary files instead of text. I will probably start with a compiler that can convert from ASCII to binary. In the future it may be more efficient to create shapes as binary directly
