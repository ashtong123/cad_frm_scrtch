Plan is to build a CAD program from scratch. Currently working on implementing some functions for 
vector manipulation in order to implement .stl file creation from a simple 3D.

Completed the functions to write an .stl file given a set of triangles. Next step will probably be a basic renderer. Later on I will need a way to define shapes more easily than manually specifying the vertices of triangles. I can probably start with primitive shapes (cube defined by l,w,h and origin, sphere defined by r and origin, etc.)
